# or 3x3), a String name, and a dictionary of figures.

        # key for each figure is the name of the figure. For example:

        # figures["A"] would return the first frame in a problem.
        # figures["3"] would return the third answer choice in a problem.
        # figures["G"] would return the third row, first column of a 3x3 problem.

        # of the problem.

        # the answer choices. Similarly, A is to C as B is to one of the answer
        # choices. In 2x2 problems, relationships are present both across the rows
        # and down the columns. The answer choices are named 1 through 6.

        # In 3x3, the figures in the first row are named from left to right A, B,
        # and C. The figures in the second row are named from left to right D, E,
        # and F. The figures in the third row are named from left to right G and H.
        # Relationships are present across rows and down columns: A is to B is to
        # C as D is to E is to F as G is to H is to one of the answer choices. A is
        # to D is G as B is to E is to H as C is to F is to one of the answer
